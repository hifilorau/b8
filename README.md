# b8

A personal finance app I built for my own household — bank sync via Plaid, a composed net-worth statement covering cash, investments and real estate, envelope-style category budgets, and a chat assistant for asking questions about spending.

Built as a hobby project to get hands-on with a production-grade Plaid integration, an LLM tool-use agent loop, and a from-scratch (no ORM) Postgres data layer, alongside my main portfolio work (ZIA API Explorer, public MCP servers).

| **Dashboard** — net worth composed from its four parts, spend pacing against budget | **Net worth** — what the total is, and what it is made of |
| ![Net worth breakdown](docs/screenshots/net-worth-breakdown.jpg) | ![Property](docs/screenshots/property.jpg) |
| **Breakdown** — every account and property behind each component; rentals collapse to one equity line | **Property** — value against mortgage over time, plus a per-property P&L |
| ![Accounts](docs/screenshots/accounts.jpg) | ![Budget](docs/screenshots/budget.jpg) |
| **Accounts** — per-account valuation mode and landscape, with per-connection sync health | **Budget** — annual allocations on a month-by-month grid |

## Features

- **Net worth** — one figure composed of four non-overlapping components (operational cash, capital/financial, real-estate equity, other debt) that sum to the total exactly. A property-linked mortgage is counted only inside its property's equity, never also as a standalone liability, so the same debt can't be subtracted twice. Properties with no valuation on record are excluded and disclosed rather than silently valued at $0
- **Dual-regime balances** — every account is either *ledger* (beginning balance + Σ transactions) or *valuation* (the latest recorded figure). A brokerage has no meaningful transaction ledger; a checking account has no meaningful "valuation". Getting this wrong is why an investment account can sit contributing $0 to net worth indefinitely, so newly linked accounts are prompted for their mode at link time
- **Reconciliation** — the ledger balance is compared against what the bank reports, and accounts that disagree are surfaced. Accounts that were never given an opening balance can be reconciled in one click; accounts that *had* one and have since diverged deliberately are not, because there the gap is evidence of a missing or duplicated transaction and moving the opening figure would bury it
- **Real estate** — per-property valuation history, equity charted as the gap between market value and the mortgage balance *as of that date*, and a per-property P&L separating operating expenses from debt service
- **Bank sync** — Plaid Link to connect accounts, incremental sync via `transactionsSync` with a cursor, pending-transaction handling to avoid duplicate postings, a daily scheduled sync, and per-connection staleness reporting (the unit that actually fails and that re-auth applies to is the Plaid Item, not the account)
- **Budgets** — per-category annual budgets with an optional month-by-month allocation schedule (for categories that aren't evenly spread across the year), status thresholds, and a monthly grid view
- **Transactions** — search/filter by amount range, account, and category; auto-categorization rules mapping Plaid categories to budget categories; manual duplication/editing for corrections; CSV import for accounts Plaid can't reach
- **Accounts** — drag-and-drop ordering, editable type/balance, relinking after a Plaid reconnect (accounts are matched back to their transaction history by `persistent_account_id`/mask rather than treated as new, and re-issued transaction IDs are matched back to the rows they replace rather than inserted as duplicates)
- **Insights & balances** — top merchants, monthly spending trends, per-account/category running balances
- **Chat assistant** — an Anthropic-powered agent with read-only tools (budget summary, monthly spending, top merchants, transaction lookup) for asking natural-language questions about your own data

## Design notes

- **Pure core, I/O shell.** The money logic — net-worth composition, drift detection, property equity, Plaid account/transaction matching, sync-health classification — lives in `lib/domain/*` as pure functions with no database access, and the query that feeds each one sits at the call site. That is what makes the arithmetic testable without a database, and it is why the test suite runs in under a second
- **Derived reads, not stored columns.** Balances, equity and drift are computed at read time from data that is already persisted. A stored copy would only ever be a cache that goes stale between syncs

## API versioning

Not versioned today — every `/api/*` route is called only by this app's own frontend, not by any consumer outside this repo, so there's no compatibility contract to protect yet. If that changes (a public MCP server, a mobile client, anything external depending on response shapes), the convention is an `/api/v1/` prefix on the routes exposed to that consumer, added at that point rather than pre-emptively; the existing unprefixed `/api/*` routes stay as-is as the internal-only surface.

## Running locally

This is a single-user, self-hosted app — it expects to be run for one person's own accounts, not deployed as a multi-tenant service.

1. `npm install`
2. Create a Postgres database (with the `pgvector` extension available — see `db/schema.sql`'s note on building it from source against Postgres 16 on Homebrew)
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your own Plaid, database, and Anthropic API credentials
4. `npm run migrate:up` — applies `migrations/` via `node-pg-migrate`, reading `DATABASE_URL` from the environment (`db/schema.sql` is kept as a human-readable reference of the same schema; the migrations are the source of truth)
5. `npm run dev`

The dev/start scripts bind to `127.0.0.1` only.

## Running via Docker

An alternative to the steps above — app + Postgres (with `pgvector`) in containers, no local Postgres install needed:

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`, fill in your credentials, and also set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (used only by the `db` container)
2. `npm run docker:up` — builds the app image, starts Postgres, runs migrations, then starts the app on `127.0.0.1:3000`
3. `npm run docker:down` to stop

Ports are published to `127.0.0.1` only, matching the dev/start scripts' own localhost-only binding.

## Note on data

This repo contains only application code and schema — no real account data, transactions, or credentials. All of that lives in a local Postgres database and a gitignored `.env.local`, neither of which is part of this repository.

That includes the screenshots above. They were produced by backing up the database, loading a wholly synthetic dataset, capturing the pages, and restoring afterwards — so every balance, bank, merchant, property and address shown is invented. Street and city names are fictional and the postal codes are deliberately invalid.

### Regenerating the screenshots

`scripts/seed-demo.mjs` produces that dataset. It is anchored to the day it runs, so the figures always look current rather than frozen at whenever the screenshots were last taken.

**It truncates every table before writing**, and the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` is normally the real database — so it refuses to run without an explicit flag, and there is no default-yes path:

```sh
pg_dump -Fc -d b8_finance -f backup.dump          # back up first
npm run seed:demo -- --yes-wipe-my-database
# …capture the pages…
psql -d b8_finance -c 'DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;'
pg_restore -d b8_finance --no-owner backup.dump   # then verify row counts match
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` in the environment to point it at a scratch database instead, which is the safer way to try it:

```sh
createdb b8_demo && DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/b8_demo npx node-pg-migrate up
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/b8_demo npm run seed:demo -- --yes-wipe-my-database
```
