// Plaid does not guarantee account_id is permanently stable for every institution —
// OAuth-based banks (Chase, Discover, ...) can reissue it for an existing account
// after a credential/session re-verification, without rotating the access_token or
// item_id. When that happens, transactions for that account stop matching our stored
// accounts.id, and would otherwise be silently dropped by the sync loop.
//
// This reconciles our accounts table against Plaid's live account list for a given
// access_token, re-pointing accounts.id to the current Plaid id whenever we can match
// the old row with high confidence. accounts.id is referenced with ON UPDATE CASCADE
// so downstream tables (transactions, account_balances, budget_categories) follow along.
//
// The matching itself lives in plaidMatch.ts as a pure function — this file is the I/O
// shell around it (fetch live accounts, apply the remaps and identifier backfills).
//
// It also surfaces the balances from that same live snapshot (`liveBalances`), which the
// accountsGet call already returns and the sync path historically discarded. Returning them
// here rather than re-fetching in lib/plaidBalances.ts keeps it at one Plaid API call per
// item per sync.
